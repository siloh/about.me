	<h2>  my character's back story: </h2>
	<p>
	Siloh is an alien fox , she was created when a species of alien crashed
	down to earth and died, scientists took the dead alien' s DNA and
	attempted to clone it over 900 times , with only one specimen 
	surviving , ( siloh). The scientists studied siloh in captivity
	for a while , then she escaped , and along her travels she met a
	husky named Apollo, Apollo was also from space, his ship had 
	crashed down and Apollo had a fatal wound in his heart, luckily
	for him siloh has two! ( one a nucular reactor one a biological heart)
	siloh gave Apollo her heart as a replacement and they fell in love </p>
